#ML3-14
Final year project of the Hong University of Science and Technology, 2015 department of ELEC group ML3-14, please contact TziYang for any issues( tziyangshao@gmail.com). This repository is created for the convenience of anyone who are willing to continue the work and expand the possibilities.
##Objective
This project was aimed to create a software framework that enables Simultaneous Localization and Mapping( A.K.A. SLAM) with multiple robots on a median level laptop. The entire framework is established on Robot Operating System( A.K.A. ROS, link http://www.ros.org/).
##Related Libraries
This framework mainly consists of two SLAM methods, a monocular density SLAM called *LSD-SLAM[1]*, and a visual-based topological SLAM called *FAB-MAP[2]*. Point cloud obtained are filtered with the help of implementation in the Point Cloud Library, *PCL[3]*.
